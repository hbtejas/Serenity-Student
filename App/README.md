Note: I couldn’t access the project files at the URL you gave — the code-server preview requires a login/password — so I created a short, generic README template you can paste into your repo and quickly edit to match the actual project files. If you want a README tailored exactly to this repo, either paste the repository tree or the main files here (or grant public access), and I’ll rewrite it specifically.

Short prompt to generate a PPT from this README

Create a 6-slide PowerPoint (concise, visual) from the README above:

Title slide: Project name, one-line description, author, date.

Problem & Solution: 2 bullets for problem, 2 bullets for solution/USP.

Key features: 3 feature cards with one-sentence descriptions.

Architecture / Project layout: simple diagram or bullet list of client / server / scripts.

Getting started: Prereqs + 3-step run instructions (clone → install → run).

Deployment & Contact: deployment notes (short) and contact/license info.

Style: clean, modern, readable fonts, one primary accent color, use icons for features, limit text per slide to 3–5 bullets.

If you want, I can now:

Generate a filled README if you paste your package.json, requirements.txt, or a list of top-level files, or

Produce the actual PPT file (I can create slides from the prompt). Which would you like?
